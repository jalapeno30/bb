	<h4>Sytem Play</h4>
	<p>You may increase your chances of winning by the System Play. Simply mark the system you want on your System Play panel and select the corresponding numbers in your game panel.</p>

	<h5>5-Roll (5R)</h5>
	<p>For only Php800.00, you may select five (5) numbers from 1 to 45 on your game panel. The computer selects the 6th number from the remaining 40 numbers you did not choose from, giving you a total of forty (40) six-number combination in the ordinary game.</p>

	<h5>System 7</h5>
	<p>It you have seven (7) numbers and you don’t know which number to drop, play System 7. The computer will give you all the possible six-number combinations from your seven (7) numbers. With System 7, seven (7) six-number combinations will be generated.</p>
	<p>For example:<br />

		Your seven (7) numbers are 02 – 05 – 17 – 23 – 29 – 36 – 41. All the possible six-number combinations are:<br />

		02 – 05 – 17 – 23 – 29 – 36<br />
		02 – 05 – 17 – 23 – 29 – 41<br />
		02 – 05 – 17 – 23 – 36 – 41<br />
		02 – 05 – 17 – 29 – 36 – 41<br />
		02 – 05 – 23 – 29 – 36 – 41<br />
		02 – 17 – 23 – 29 – 36 – 41<br />
		05 – 17 – 23 – 29 – 36 – 41<br />
		The same procedure and principle applies to Systems 9, 10, 11 and 12. Refer to the table for the corresponding number of combinations per System Play and the cost. Remember, Php20.00 for every six-number combination.</p>
